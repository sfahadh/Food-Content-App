# Nutrition-Thermodynamics
A food nutrition app in which you can grab the nutrient database of the food of choice and use that information 
to track calories.

## About the App
The purpose of this app is to look for the nutrient content of a selected food by accessing an API's database. By getting the data information of the nutrient content of the selected food, the user can track it for his/her benefits such as knowing how many calories he/she consume or if he/she has a target ratio of carbs to fats to consume, and etc.

There will be a total of 4 pages in this app each with it's own unique components except for the navbar, which will remain constant for each page. In total, there will be 7 components used and I will go over them more in details below when I describe each page.

## API Keys Used
  - **USDA Food Composition Databases:** https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/index
  - **openFDA:** https://open.fda.gov/
  
## Wireframe for Page 1
The first page of the wireframe shows the blueprint of how I'm going to structure the landing page. It will be 
composed of 2 components
